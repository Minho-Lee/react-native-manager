# react-native-manager

## Course on Udemy: [React-Native-Redux-Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/ "React-Native Course")

###### Lots of bugs since the course is over a year old. The buggiest one is [react-native-router-flux]('https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux') and it is most likely because the course utilizes v3, and now there's v4 where it made lots of v3 functionalities obsolete.

###### Overall, great course! Would recommend to anyone that wants to start learning [react-native]('https://facebook.github.io/react-native/')
